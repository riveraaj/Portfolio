## Description

This is a refactoring of code from my [Vanilla-Porfolio](https://github.com/riveraaj/Vanilla-Portfolio), in this case it was done in React.. In this occasion we used animation libraries, as well as Vite to build the project, in this case Vite does not use WebPack but uses SWC. You will also find some projects in which I have used backend technologies, such as JAVA, PHP, etc. and SQL and NoSQL databases.

This portfolio is constantly updated with new projects and improvements to existing ones. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

#### Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- React
- Vite
